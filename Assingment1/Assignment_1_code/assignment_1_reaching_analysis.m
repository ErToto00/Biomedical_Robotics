%% Assignment 1 - MCI reaching task: analysis
%
% The pipeline, step by step:
%   Part 1  raw EMG -> your own envelopes (conventional filtering),
%           compared with the envelopes the MCI computed live
%   Part 2  the MCI map: muscles -> cursor velocity (given in the .mat)
%   Part 3  rebuild the cursor from the envelopes and compare it with the
%           logged one
%   Part 4  performance per reach
%   BONUS   drive a simulated 2-link robot arm with your cursor
%
% Input: your group's .mat file. It contains:
%   centerout          table, one row per sample: t, raw_<muscle>,
%                      env_<muscle>, cursor_x_px, cursor_y_px, cursor_x_cm, cursor_y_cm
%   centerout_targets  table, one row per target: target_x_px, target_y_px,
%                      spawn_time, hit_time, reach_time, overshoots
%   random, random_targets   the same for the random task
%   info               sampling frequency, muscles, screen, calibration, MCI map
% (double-click a table in the Workspace to see it like a spreadsheet)
%
% Toolbox needed: Signal Processing Toolbox (butter, filtfilt, xcorr).

%% 1. Load the data
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The .mat already contains only the game part of the recording, with a
% regular time vector starting at 0. (In the original txt files the time
% column is uneven, because samples reach the PC in bursts, but there are
% exactly 2000 samples per second, so the time was rebuilt from the
% sample index.)

% Pick the task we analyze
if strcmp(task, 'centerout')

end

screenPx = info.screen_px;            % screen resolution [px]
cmPerPx  = info.cm_per_px;            % [cm per px]
centerPx = info.center_px;            % center target [px]
MAX      = info.calib_max;            % value of each muscle that the MCI calls 100%

% The table has one column per muscle (e.g. raw_R_biceps). For filtering
% it is handier to have the 4 muscles side by side in one matrix, so take
% those columns out of the table by name (column order = info.muscles).
muscleCols = strrep(muscles, ' ', '_');               % 'R biceps' -> 'R_biceps'

% Extract these variables from the table D and from targets:
%   t         time [s]                                     (N x 1)
%   raw       raw EMG, one column per muscle               (N x 4)
%   envMCI   MCI envelopes, one column per muscle (0-1)  (N x 4)
%   cursorPx  cursor position [px], y grows DOWNWARD       (N x 2)
%   cursorCm  cursor position [cm]                         (N x 2)
%   targetPx  target positions [px], one row per target    (nTargets x 2)

% YOUR CODE HERE


% Units: the raw EMG is stored in ADC counts. The sensors use a signed
% 16-bit converter (-32768 ... +32767) over an input range of +-2.5 mV, so
% one count is 2500 uV / 32768 = 0.0763 uV. We convert to microvolts so the
% plots have physical units. MAX comes from the same raw signal, so it is
% converted too (the normalized envelopes, 0-1, don't change).
uVperCount = 2500 / 32768;            % [uV per ADC count]
raw = raw * uVperCount;               % raw EMG [uV]
MAX = MAX * uVperCount;               % calibration max [uV]

N = numel(t);
fprintf('Loaded %s, %s task: %d samples = %.1f s, %d targets\n', ...
        info.system, task, N, t(end), height(targets));
fprintf('Muscles: %s\n', strjoin(muscles, ', '));


%% PART 1 - Preprocessing (conventional pipeline, as in Assignment 1)
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 1) Band-pass 30-450 Hz: keeps the EMG band, removes movement artifacts
%    and offset (<30 Hz) and high-frequency noise (>450 Hz).
% 2) Rectify: EMG goes positive and negative around zero; its size (how
%    hard the muscle works) is in the absolute value.
% 3) Low-pass 5 Hz: smooths the rectified signal into an envelope that
%    follows the muscle activation, not the single spikes.
% 4) Normalize by MAX: puts every muscle on the same 0-1 scale, like the MCI.
%
% We use filtfilt (forward + backward): it has NO delay. The MCI works
% live, so it can only use past samples and its envelope has a delay.
% This is the main difference you will see in the comparison below.
%
% Steps (all 4 muscles at once: filtfilt works column by column):
%   a) design the band-pass and the low-pass filters
%   b) remove the DC offset from raw (subtract the mean of each column)
%   c) band-pass             -> emgFilt  (N x 4) [uV]
%   d) rectify               -> emgRect  (N x 4) [uV]
%   e) low-pass              -> envOurs  (N x 4) [uV]
%   f) normalize: divide each column by its MAX  -> envOurs (0-1)
%   g) filtering can dip slightly below 0: set negative values to 0

% YOUR CODE HERE


% --- Figure 1: the preprocessing steps for each muscle, on a 3 s window
% with some activity (easier to see). For each muscle plot:
%   - raw and filtered EMG [uV]
%   - rectified EMG with the envelope on top [uV]
% Label the axes with units.

% YOUR CODE HERE


% --- Compare your envelopes with the MCI ones (envMCI)
% For each muscle:
%   - correlation between the two envelopes (corrcoef): same shape?
%   - delay between them: the lag of the peak of xcorr (convert it to ms)
% Then plot the two envelopes on top of each other (a 30 s window is enough).

% YOUR CODE HERE


% --- Downsample to 100 Hz
% WHY only now: the envelope is a slow signal (below 5 Hz), so 100 Hz is
% plenty. Doing it BEFORE filtering would alias the EMG (which goes up to
% 450 Hz) and destroy it. The cursor also only updates ~60 times per second.
step = fs / fsDown;                        % keep 1 sample every 20
dt   = 1 / fsDown;                         % time between downsampled samples [s]
% Keep one sample every 'step' and create:
%   tD, envOursD, envMCID, cursorCmD

% YOUR CODE HERE



%% PART 2 - The MCI map (given)
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The MCI is in velocity control: the muscles set the cursor SPEED.
% Each axis is driven by a pair of muscles, and the speed is proportional
% to their DIFFERENCE, so contracting both together cancels out:
%
%     x speed = gain * (muscle A - muscle B)      (biceps pair)
%     y speed = gain * (muscle C - muscle D)      (trapezius pair)
%
% gain = Max Cursor Speed (50 cm/s): a muscle at 100% with the other one
% relaxed moves the cursor at 50 cm/s. The .mat stores the map (info.W) as a
% matrix W, one row per axis and one column per muscle, so that for all
% samples at once:
%
%     velocity (N x 2) = gain * envelopes (N x 4) * W'
gain = info.gain_cm_s;                     % [cm/s]
W    = info.W;                             % 2 x 4
fprintf('\nPart 2 - MCI map\n');
fprintf('  x speed        = %g * (%s)\n', gain, info.map_x);
fprintf('  y speed (down) = %g * (%s)\n', gain, info.map_y);

% Dead zone: the MCI ignores any muscle below 5% of its max, so that
% resting noise does not move the cursor. Without this step the rebuilt
% cursor creeps away from the real one even when the subject is relaxed.
deadZone = 0.05;

% 1) Apply the dead zone to envOursD and to envMCID (values below
%    deadZone become 0)
% 2) Compute the cursor velocity [cm/s] with the formula above:
%      velOurs  from your envelopes      (N x 2)
%      velMCI  from the MCI envelopes  (N x 2)

% YOUR CODE HERE



%% PART 3 - Rebuild the cursor from the envelopes
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Velocity from the map (Part 2), then integrate (position = previous position +
% velocity * dt). Like the real cursor, ours can't leave the screen, so we
% clip it at the edges at every step.
%
% Integrating adds up every small error, so the rebuilt cursor slowly
% drifts away from the real one (try resetAtEachTarget = false to see it).
% With the reset, we restart from the logged position at each new target,
% so the error only builds up within one reach.
screenCm = info.screen_cm;                       % screen size [cm]
spawnT   = targets.spawn_time;                   % when each target appears [s]

% Rebuild two cursors, posOurs and posMCI [cm] (nD x 2, nD = numel(tD)),
% from velOurs and velMCI:
%   1) start both from the logged position: cursorCmD(1,:)
%   2) for each sample k = 2..nD: previous position + velocity * dt
%   3) clip to the screen: between [0 0] and screenCm
%   4) if resetAtEachTarget is true: at the first sample after each
%      spawnT, set both positions back to the logged one
% Then compute, for both, the distance from the logged cursor at each
% sample (errOurs, errMCI [cm]) and print its mean.

% Targets, converted to cm -> targCm (nTargets x 2)

end



%% PART 4 - Performance per reach
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Each trial goes from the moment the target appears (spawn_time) to the
% moment it is hit (hit_time). In center-out, every other target is the
% center (the way back): we look at the outward reaches only. In the
% random task all targets count.
%   1) select the reaches to use: target hit (hit_time is not NaN) and
%      target not at the center (targetPx differs from centerPx)
%   2) for each of them, plot in order (a learning curve):
%      - the reach time [s]            (targets.reach_time)
%      - the overshoots [count]        (targets.overshoots)
